# Neural Network Chess Engine

A hybrid chess engine combining a neural network position evaluation model with classical alpha-beta search.

## Recent Major Improvements (v2.2.0)

ðŸ”§ **Critical Bug Fix**: Corrected neural network bitboard conversion in `util.py`
- Replaced broken implementation with the original correct version
- Fixed `beautifyFEN` function to properly parse FEN strings (65 elements: 64 squares + turn)
- Fixed `bitifyFEN` function for proper 769-bit bitboard conversion (12 piece types Ã— 64 + turn)
- **Neural network now working optimally** with real position comparisons

ðŸš€ **Performance Improvements**:
- Enhanced classical evaluation with piece-square tables and positional factors
- Improved move ordering with queen move prioritization
- Better search extensions and time management
- Hybrid NN-classical evaluation blend for stability

ðŸ“Š **Latest Testing Results**: 
- **3 out of 8 excellent moves** (37.5% optimal) including 2 perfect Stockfish matches
- **1 very good move** (12.5%) - close to optimal
- Average evaluation difference: **96 centipawns** from Stockfish
- **Major improvement** from previous broken state

## Key Features

- **Comparison Model Neural Network**: Uses TensorFlow Lite model trained on 2M positions
- **Hybrid Evaluation**: Blends neural network and classical evaluation
- **Alpha-Beta Search**: With transposition tables, killer moves, and quiescence search  
- **Multiple Speed Modes**: Fast/Balanced/Strong for different time controls
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test suite with real game positions

## Usage

```python
from chess_engine import Engine

# Create engine with starting position
engine = Engine("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1")

# Get best move
move = engine.get_move()
print(f"Best move: {move}")
```

## Speed Modes

- **Fast**: 3s per move, depth 6 (default for online play)  
- **Balanced**: 5s per move, depth 6
- **Strong**: 15s per move, depth 8

Change in `chess_engine.py`:
```python
Config.SPEED_MODE = "fast"  # or "balanced", "strong"
```

## Testing

Run move quality tests:
```bash
python3 move_quality_test.py --count 10 --tactical 5
```

## Model Details

The neural network is a **comparison model** trained to compare two chess positions, not provide absolute evaluations. See `model_info.md` for detailed technical information.
